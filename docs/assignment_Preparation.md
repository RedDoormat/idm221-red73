I enjoy how the website is layed out. Text and emages fall into place as you scroll and everything feels like it's being layered upon in a presentation of sorts. The website also features scrolling for a long time so you can fit more images and information onto one page rather than hopping to many different pages for the same info but continued.

- [Zumiez](https://www.zumiez.com/ "Zumiez") This website has uniformity behind it and I enjoy that. The navigational menu bar stays consistant throughout where you are and you can traverse easily to where you want to be.

- [Skate Warehouse](https://www.skatewarehouse.com/buildcomplete.html/ "Skate Warehouse") This website has a "Build Your Own Complete Skateboard" functionality. The function operates really well, the peices you need to fill the board are layed out and as you choose parts they fill in on the neat organized layout.

## About Me
---
My name is Reid Dumont. I grew up in a rural town in New Jersey and now I am studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia under their Interactive Digital Media major. In the future I would like to work in user interface design and web development.

I have a good amount of hobbies I enjoy divulging in. The biggest is my love of videogames. My favorite genre is rpg games. I also find fun in creating and painting model kits. I also find fun in creating art. I sketch a fair amount and enjoy inking pieces greatly. 

My biggest influence on my life are my friends. I find a lot of good qualities in people that I in turn want to replicate in myself. It's the amalgamation of those qualities plus my interests and personality that made me who I am today. I'm able to pursue my interests and endeavors a lot easier because I surround myself with people whom I look up to. 

I have minor work and coding experience. I have taken classes in the Python programing language. I have also worked inventory management at a valet parking company for many summers. I have a good work ethic and will complete objectives efficiently. Often when I start something I would like to see it through in the same work session, realistically this is not always possible but it definitely drives me to continue working.
